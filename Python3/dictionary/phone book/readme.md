# PhoneBook

Almost all mobile phones have this feature "contacts" or "phonebook".  This app will keep a list of your friends' name and contact number.

We are going to code that App using Python Dictionary.

----
Your App should print a menu like this, and accept the user's selection.

1. Print Phone Numbers
2. Add a Phone Number
3. Remove a Phone Number
4. Lookup a Phone Number
5. Quit

The menu has 5 options.  The user can only input number 1 to 5.  All other inputs are rejected.

----
How would you code this App?

Hints:
1. How would you initialize an empty Python Dictionary?
2. How would you insert a record into a Python Dictionary?
3. How would you delete a record into a Python Dictionary?
4. How would you print the contents of a Python Dictionary?
5. How would you search using the key of a Python Dictionary?

*You may also like to make the search using name to be case-insensitive.
